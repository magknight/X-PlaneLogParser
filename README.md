# X-PlaneLogParser
As the name suggests, it's a parser for the X-Plane log file. I was getting really annoyed with having to look through people's log files when they were immensely log, and contained 90% stuff I didn't care about. Here, my solution is to remove the lines that are not of interest.

It's not very exciting
